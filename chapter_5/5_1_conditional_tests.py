# Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement
# describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code
# should look something like this:

icepop = 'watermelon'

print("Is your favourite icepop flavor 'watermelon'? I predict True.")
print(icepop == 'watermelon')

print("\nIs your favourite icepop flavor 'mango'? I predict False.")
print(icepop == 'mango')

# Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line
# evaluates to True or False.

# Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another
# 5 tests evaluate to False.

icepop = 'watermelon'

print("Is your favourite icepop flavor 'watermelon'? I predict True.")
print(icepop == 'watermelon')

print("\nIs your favourite icepop flavor 'mango'? I predict False.")
